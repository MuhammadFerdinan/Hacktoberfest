## What is Google Colaboratory?

Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, 
and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no 
setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

Google Colaboratory is free to use.

With Google Colaboratory you can use and share Jupyter notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything.
