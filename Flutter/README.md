## Description
Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

### Flutter Advantages
1. Fast Development
2. Similar to native app development 
3. Large community support
4. Expressive and Flexible UI
5. One code base

### Dart platform
Flutter apps are written in the Dart language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.

On Windows, macOS, and Linux Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine. While writing and debugging an app, Flutter uses Just In Time compilation, allowing for "hot reload", with which modifications to source files can be injected into a running application. Flutter extends this with support for stateful hot reload, where in most cases changes to source code are reflected immediately in the running app without requiring a restart or any loss of state.
